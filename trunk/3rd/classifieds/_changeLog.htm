<h4><strong>Updates in v1.03 </strong> </h4>
<p>Fixed: Typo on $serverPath variable by... On all emails and RSS it now detects 
  domain and directory so there is no need to emss with $serverPath variable <br>
  Fixed: On the same file &#8220;email_newItem.php&#8221; on line 8, $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] 
  returns the server name including www. So an email will appear something like 
  email@www.server.com instead of email@server.com . The same applies from line 
  9.<br>
  Fixed: When I uploaded the database I had to manually mark &#8220;postId&#8221; 
  and &#8220;cat_id&#8221; as auto_increasment to work.<br>
  Fixed: Updated the whole admin key thing; When I login to admin panel and click 
  &#8220;View Site in Admin Mode&#8221; after I make a change, like deleting a 
  post, I have to relogin to be able to make a new change.</p>
